	<br><br>
	<p><b>Welcome to our about us page.This is our Digital Thinking and Innovation project
		Our team name is G.O.L.D and this is our project blood bank management system.</b></p>

	<p>A blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation is stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. 
		The term "blood bank" typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product occurs and 
		where proper testing is performed (to reduce the risk of transfusion related adverse events).</p>
	<p><b>Why Blood banks?ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”</b></p>
	<p>The blood bank plays an important role in patient care. Transfusion-related errors have serious consequence for patients, including death. 
		Proper identification of the patient and blood products is critical in avoiding such transfusion-related reactions.</p>
